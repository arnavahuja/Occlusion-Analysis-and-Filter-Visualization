# Occlusion-Analysis-and-Filter-Visualization
This is a part of my learning experiences with CNNs
Occlusion sensitivity is a simple technique for understanding which parts of an image are most important for a deep network's classification. 
Filter visualization is done to realize what exactly are the filters learning in a CNN, so that the outputs can be better understood
